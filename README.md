This is my academic project for Semester 5
The project uses MERN stack
Third party apis such as github api has be used also, gravatar has been used to prevent unnecessary storage issues and to avoid file management.
About the project- This can be simply said as the social media application for developers.
The user can make an account, create their profile link their social media accounts and github accounts
The user's 5 recent github repos will be indicated on their profile.
Users can post "posts" and can like and comment on posts.
It also uses hashes the passwords and then only saves it in the database using bcrypt js.
The project can't be said as the best but all the efforts have been made to make it as good as possible.
